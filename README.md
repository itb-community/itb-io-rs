# ITB IO

Lua-interfacing library of helper functions related to dealing with basic IO and file system navigation, in a way that prevents Lua from touching files it is not allowed to. Intended as a supporting library for the [Mod Loader](https://github.com/itb-community/ITB-ModLoader) for the game [Into the Breach](https://subsetgames.com/itb.html).

For notes on building, troubleshooting, etc., see the README of [FTLDat-rs](https://github.com/itb-community/ftldat-rs), whose setup is identical.
